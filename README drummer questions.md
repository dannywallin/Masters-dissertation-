**how did you feel playing to a metronome ?

I felt like I could count the measures of the song more consistently and my playing felt more structured. 

**how did you feel playing with out a metronome ? 

I felt that although it was harder keeping my playing completely even, I had freedom to play around with drum fills more.

**how did you feel playing with a band compared to playing individually ? 

I feel playing in a band allows me to bounce ideas off the other musicians where as playing solo allowed me to focus on my parts more, however there is more pressure playing alone.

**What did you find challenging and why in both songs ?

Keeping on top of some of the song structures and making dynamics sound human rather than too intentional/planned out and predictable. 

**how did the difference between alot going on in the rock song compared to the pop which was slower and less going on effected you overall?

 I think the Rock track really ramped up things towards the end of the session when we had already been in the studio a while, meaning I felt like my energy didn’t come through after the first few runs, whilst I feel the pop track freed me up much more for dynamics and breathing space within my playing.

**how did the dynamics effect you ? and how did you try and stick to the dynamics through out ? along with the timbre which get affected dynamics 

The dynamics in the rock song affected my playing because the changes were so sudden, it meant I had to quickly and drastically change my approach to the drum kit for example playing fills on particular parts of the kit. In the pop song the dynamics were much more expected and stronger so when it got to a different section it became easier to remember that this section was quieter/louder and I could transfer to light Cymbal work/full kit easier. This also meant that getting across the feelings of the song became easier in the pop track as I could collectively bounce fills and rhythms off the other players, this meaning it wasn’t going to be too similar from take to take. With the rock track it was much more specific fills leading in to sections meaning it was an almost pre-emoted way of playing.



**how did the emotion form each song effect you ? example the pop song being slow and relaxed compared to the rock song which was more complex and faster ?

The pop song started off the recording session in a much more relaxed manner meaning that the pop song felt like it flowed from me as a player more, the rock song however I felt I was under prepared (on my own part) for this piece and it took a lot more of my own concentration maybe causing the track to loose it’s human and natural feel.

**For Aglaia Foteinou**
**7MU011 Audio Technology**
**2018/2019**


The purpose of this blog is to capture the weeks leading up to the final day, beginning form meetings, research, recordings and finally submitting the report.    

**Week 1**

During the first week of planning the dissertation in the summer, a meeting was arranged to discuss the variables such as instruments as well as parameters along with what other researches have researched over time correlating to this report. Ideas were discussed with the advisor about for the songs to write, this ranged from technical aspects including timbre, dynamics and tempo. The instruments that have been discussed are electric Electric Guitar, Bass Guitar and Drums.


**Week 2** 

This helped to gain ideas for the abstract to discuss that would include the overall report. This would discuss how how music has been helped but also effected by (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) MIDI since the origin. As well as what the task in hand will be involving recording musicians to help discuss the recording and comparing the recordings to the computer generated songs. Two different styles will be recorded to the original backing tracks to test each recorded take with and with out a metronome, this was to explain what was possible and what was not in order to argue the case between MIDI and live instruments.


**Week 3** 

Moving on from this, Whilst discussing what variables and parameters are, this lead me into researching these and help me further my discussion on the written aspect and what to do for testing in the recording stage. Deciding what instruments to use and why along with which genres to test to try and gain the best results.  


**Week 4**

Research began on the main topics of discussion of tempo form researchers including Ursula Debarnot, discussing  the effects of tempo in a live station compared to studio situation along with a metronome and without a metronome. Researcher David Wessel on google scholar researching what timbre and dynamics have in common and how each other effect one another. When researching the genre, consideration were taken into how long each song was going to be and how this would effect dynamics, tempo and tempo through each recording. Further talks with the Advisor on how the songs will be composed, on a instrument or with MIDI instruments.  


**Week 5**

Books were taken from university and found online find research on phycology research including McLeod, S. (2019). , this was to find research on working with peoples mindsets when recording music which is a major factor for this report. This will help with they way the musicians are worked with in the recording session, making them feel comfortable and try and make them feel less nervous knowing what their job is. This would also help when rehearsing the songs and help their mind set whilst plying the song to the best of their ability, for example Practice of each which will help each participant  will help then in the final recording.


**Week 6** 

The songwriting began in Cubase, Inspiration for this was from pop songs four searching on youtube to help start writing the song. Experimenting with chords sounds on the MIDI keyboard. A simple chords progression was eventually created to work for the song. This plan is for musicians not to find it too technical for song one with will a pop song. The chords were written in a simple key so make it mac more easier to compose a melody line the top of the chords and a tempo of 135 beats for per minute (BPM). Loops and a simple drumbeat was created to add to the chords that had been written into Cubase. Screenshot below to showcase the writing from the pop song. (Copy of the chords written are shown in appendix 1 and 2)

**Week 7**

Looking for papers and books for research on emotion in performances from authors Raymond Macdonald who book Musical communication and John Sloboda, Psychology for musicians. These books will help to retrieve more in-depth information on this subject. Searches through google scholar as well as google books to help find more information. 


**Week 8** 

Research on emotion with book and studies found at the university library and online papers. Paragraph on Ethical considerations was written up to discuss that was needed to the recording so no one and would be harmed or effected in any way.


**Week 9** 

The second song which was inspired by more rock bands such as green day and Blink 182, MIDI rock drums were used to create the rock sound, a MIDI keyboard was used for the chords and melody. The melody was much faster, this was create so it would test the guitarist much more, same goes for the drummer. This will help comparing and contrasting the two different songs, especially a rock song that has along more dynamics in the song and technical ability throughout the guitar playing and the drum fills throughout the song.  Additionally this will help with the emotion a different style of music will effect their mindset Week 10 screenshot below shows the music that was written for the rock song.

Below is a screenshot of the MIDI that was used to create the drums for the rock song before being sent to the musicians. Further-more, (the chords for the song are shown in appendix 3)

**Week 10**

Further research in the university library for academics on research reading quantitative research and qualitative research. Academic including Bradley,N (2013) and Denscombe, M. (2014). Helped to dive deeper into quantitative research and qualitative research and this will help lead me to understanding how to write and research questions for the participants taking art in this. 


**Week 11**

Additionally, a Skype meeting was arranged with the advisor updating on what research is needed to be added, ranged from being questioned about the aim and objectives. Lots of changes needed which prompted in changes throughout the report being made that included the literature review , abstract. This resulted in more books being taken out including Computer Sound Synthesis in 1951: The Music of CSIRAC by Williams,R. (2004). . This talked about the history of the first computer generated music as well talking talking about what MIDI is and the history up today along with advantages and disadvantages of this.  


**Week 12**

Whilst planning what scenarios to test participant on planning was on the way to arrange a date that would work for everybody involved. I had discussions with another participant but she struggled  to commit with her availability she she bought another name to my attention who eventually did the recording which lead me onto messaging another student.

**Week 13**

Leading up the recording, messages were send out to each student asking for their availability due to everyone having busy schedules. Dates were being agreed but due to not being ready and other participants not available, dates were being changed.

**Week 14**

The participants arrived on the Tuesday of the recording session in the afternoon all prepared. All the equipment was set up and the evening went to plan along with all the scenarios planned.

Figure 6 Picture taken from the recording session


During the recording process there was twelve takes all together, three rock and four in rock as a full band and the remaining takes were for section of each song form both genres. Throughout the first few takes for the pop song  During 0.57 of take one and three of the recordings, the drums have similar drum fills around 0.57 whereas take two and four do not.  Around 1.05 a note in the chorus was plucked hard before going back to a softer playing style, for the duration of the chorus.


Following on from the recordings with the metronome, the band was tested on playing a small section of the pop song to the backing track with a metronome. It was cohesive to the backing track, despite this there was a difference between both takes. For example the bass played a note late 2.06 of the song (screenshot for example). Following on from this when the band played the song but without a metronome, the bassist played a extra note around 0.47- 0.49.

**Rock song with metronome**

Take three

The bassist appeared to be struggling to play the song as he followed the lead guitarist. This affects timing and the cohesion of the song (see 0.18, 0.21, 0.30 and 0.53). However, the guitarist stopped playing at 1.25 which affected the bass who stopped playing and started again at 1.27. At 1.33 the whole band stopped and then started again at 1.34

Additionally, It took the drummer four takes until he was able to play the snare roll clearly at 1.22. At 2.19 the bass gets louder for 3 seconds then changes to a softer style. This again refers back to how dynamics change when playing a more upbeat rock song (Stuart, 1997).

Moving on form the full song recordings, the bands also played small sections of the rock song, below are section for each instrument.  

After the full band recordings were finished 

**Drums**

Both takes were played well but as shown in the screenshot but in each recorded take there are differences in performance.

**Guitar**

When playing the guitar track solo’d it plays well to the metronome along with the original track on the other-hand the recorded clip without the metronome has a wrong chord which was played during 0.57. 

**Bass**

The bass recording to the metronome was very well played and played to the metronome, on the other hand the dynamics and tempo was very different when playing without a metronome.


**Week 15** 

Once The recording was finished, the Methodology write up began. Step by step write up on the recording linking back the the literature review. This helped to go into a lot of in-depth information on both rock and pop songs that were recorded. This also help the argument on the literature review linking the emotion, dynamics, timbre and tempo of the differences between computer generated music and live performances

**how did you feel playing to a metronome** ? 

I felt comfortable playing to a metronome however with both the backing track and live band at times it difficult to concentrate on just the metronome. 

**how did you feel playing with out a metronome** ? 

I felt comfortable playing without the metronome but I then had to focus and be more aware of the drummer and make sure to lock with him. 

**how did you feel playing with a band compared to playing individually** ? 

Personally I prefer to play with a band as you can react to each others playing. For example, knowing when to push harder or when to pull back is easier with a band. Playing individually was easier along side the backing track and metronome as I did not need to focus on what my band mates were playing but only on the backing track. 

**how did if feel playing the melody in the rock song** ? 

Playing the melody of the rock song was technically/mechanically easy but due to the somewhat chaotic nature of the song meaning it was a challenge to focus on the backing track whilst playing with the band. 

**what did you find challenging and why in both songs** ? 

For the pop song I did not find it very challenging but it was making sure I was in time with the rest of the band and playing with the same feel. For the rock song I found playing with both the band and backing challenging. One reason was because the backing track already included a programmed drum part with its own fills, so meaning if the drummer did not play the exact same part it sounded extremely chaotic. 

**how did the difference between alot going on in the rock song compared to the pop which was slower and less going on effected you overall** ? 

As previously mentioned the pop song was very easy to play with a band but due to the fact the rock song already had a drum part this made the song difficult to play with both a real and programmed drummer. Once I play with just the backing track by myself I found it much easier.
